Here are **strong, senior-level comparison points** between **Gloo Ambient Mesh** and a **traditional enterprise networking setup** (API gateways, firewalls, L4 load balancers, VLANs, service discovery, mTLS via certs, etc.).
These points are designed to be **presentation-ready** and impactful.

---

# **Gloo Ambient Mesh vs. Traditional Networking – Key Comparison Points**

---

## **1. Architecture Model**

### **Traditional Networking**

* IP-based routing and segmentation (VLANs, subnets)
* Heavy reliance on centralized L4/L7 appliances (F5, Nginx, HAProxy)
* Static routes, static firewall rules
* No concept of *service identity*, only IP/port-based rules
* Application teams depend on networking team for changes

### **Gloo Ambient Mesh**

* Identity-based routing (SPIFFE IDs)
* Distributed enforcement via ztunnel + waypoints
* Dynamic traffic policies controlled by platform teams
* No reliance on static network segmentation
* Decouples app connectivity from infra networking

---

## **2. Zero-Trust & Security**

### **Traditional Networking**

* Security perimeter at ingress/DMZ; East-west traffic often flat
* Manual mTLS or certificate management
* IP spoofing & lateral movement risks
* Limited visibility into service-level security

### **Gloo Ambient Mesh**

* Built-in per-service mTLS (zero-trust by default)
* Identity-based access control (not IP-based)
* Encryption for all service-to-service traffic
* Visibility into policies, flows, and identity at L4 and L7

---

## **3. Scalability**

### **Traditional Networking**

* Central appliances become bottlenecks
* Scaling requires buying bigger hardware
* Traffic hairpinning → latency + cost
* More services = more firewall rules = more complexity

### **Gloo Ambient Mesh**
