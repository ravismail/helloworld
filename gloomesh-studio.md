Here's a sample **Jira story description** and **acceptance criteria** for creating a Namespace in a Kubernetes cluster:

---

**Story Title:** Create a New Namespace in Kubernetes Cluster

**Description:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a dedicated Kubernetes Namespace for the `<project/application name>` so that we can isolate resources, apply access controls, and manage deployments independently from other workloads in the cluster.

This Namespace will be used for organizing and managing resources related to `<project/application name>`, such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. It should follow the organizational naming conventions and be created in the appropriate cluster environment (e.g., dev, test, prod).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A Kubernetes Namespace named `<namespace-name>` is created in the `<cluster-environment>` cluster.
2. The Namespace name follows the agreed naming convention: `[team]-[project]-[env]` (e.g., `devops-portal-dev`).
3. The Namespace is listed when running `kubectl get namespaces`.
4. Appropriate labels are applied to the Namespace (e.g., `team`, `environment`, `owner`).
5. RBAC policies (if applicable) are applied to restrict access to the Namespace.
6. Namespace creation is logged or documented in the internal tracking system or GitOps repository (if applicable).
7. A basic test deployment (e.g., a simple nginx pod) can be successfully deployed and accessed within the new Namespace.
