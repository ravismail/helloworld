Tomcat 9 introduced the **HealthCheckValve**, a configurable valve that performs health checks on the server and provides the status of its components. It is a lightweight, built-in mechanism to ensure the server's health.

---

### **Key Features of HealthCheckValve**
1. **Lightweight Monitoring**: Designed to provide a simple health-check mechanism without requiring complex setup.
2. **Configurable Responses**: Supports returning status responses based on server health.
3. **Integration with Load Balancers**: Ideal for use in cloud and distributed environments where load balancers need periodic health checks.
4. **HTTP Response Codes**:
   - **200 (OK)**: Server is healthy.
   - **500 (Internal Server Error)**: Server is unhealthy.

---

### **Enabling HealthCheckValve**

To use the **HealthCheckValve**, configure it in the `server.xml` file.

#### Example Configuration:
```xml
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.HealthCheckValve"
       checkInterval="5000"
       maxMemory="90"
       maxNonHeapMemory="90"
       maxThreadsBusy="80"
       maxGarbageCollectionTime="2000"/>
```

#### Explanation of Attributes:
- **`checkInterval`**: Interval (in milliseconds) between health checks (default: `3000`).
- **`maxMemory`**: Maximum percentage of heap memory usage before marking the server unhealthy.
- **`maxNonHeapMemory`**: Maximum percentage of non-heap memory usage before marking the server unhealthy.
- **`maxThreadsBusy`**: Maximum percentage of busy threads before marking the server unhealthy.
- **`maxGarbageCollectionTime`**: Maximum garbage collection time (in milliseconds) before marking the server unhealthy.

---

### **Accessing the Health Check**

Once enabled, the **HealthCheckValve** responds to requests at the context path you specify. For example:
```shell
curl -I http://<your-tomcat-server>:<port>/health
```

### **Response Example**
- If healthy:
  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Length: 0
  ```
- If unhealthy:
  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
  Content-Length: 0
  ```

---

### **Advanced Usage**

1. **Integration with Load Balancers**:
   - Configure your load balancer to probe the health check endpoint periodically to determine if the Tomcat server is healthy.

2. **Customizing Thresholds**:
   - Modify the `maxMemory`, `maxThreadsBusy`, or other attributes to align with your application's needs.

3. **Extending Health Checks**:
   - You can subclass the `HealthCheckValve` and override its methods to add custom health-check logic.

---

### **Logs and Troubleshooting**
The HealthCheckValve writes log entries to the standard Tomcat logs (`catalina.out` or equivalent) for debugging. Check these logs if the server is marked unhealthy unexpectedly.

Managing Docker golden images effectively is essential to maintain consistency, security, and performance across environments. Here’s a breakdown of best practices and methods for Docker golden image management:

### 1. **Definition of a Golden Image**
   - A **golden image** is a pre-configured, secure, and optimized Docker image that serves as a baseline for creating other images. It typically includes necessary software, configurations, and dependencies that are required by applications across environments.

### 2. **Image Creation Process**
   - Start with a **base image**: Use lightweight, official base images (e.g., `ubuntu`, `alpine`) to reduce attack surfaces and keep images minimal.
   - **Layer optimization**: Structure Dockerfiles to limit the number of layers and minimize unnecessary intermediate files. For instance, use multi-stage builds for complex images.
   - **Security**: Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like **Clair, Anchore, Trivy,** or **Docker Bench for Security**. This is especially important for golden images that will be replicated widely.
   - **Configurations**: Include standardized configurations in the golden image to reduce setup time and prevent deviations across environments.

### 3. **Versioning and Tagging**
   - Implement a **versioning strategy** (e.g., semantic versioning like `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`) to track changes and updates.
   - Use **tags** to distinguish between stable, testing, or latest versions of the golden image. Common tags include `latest`, `stable`, `dev`, and specific version numbers (e.g., `v1.2.3`).

### 4. **Repository Management**
   - Store images in a **centralized repository** like **Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Azure ACR,** or **Google Container Registry**.
   - Set up access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can modify or push updates to the golden image.

### 5. **Automation for Image Updates**
   - Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the process of building, scanning, and publishing golden images. Tools like **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD,** or **GitHub Actions** can automate this workflow.
   - Automate security scans and generate alerts for vulnerabilities in images, even in deployed containers, to facilitate timely patching.

### 6. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Regularly **review and update** golden images to ensure they contain the latest patches, dependencies, and optimizations.
   - Implement a **deprecation policy** for old images. Notify teams when an image will no longer be maintained and plan for migrating workloads to updated images.

### 7. **Monitoring and Compliance**
   - Monitor image usage across environments, ensuring they comply with security and configuration standards.
   - Establish policies and audits to ensure that all production images originate from the golden image or meet the same quality criteria.

### 8. **Documentation**
   - Document the creation and maintenance process of the golden image. Include information on base image choices, security requirements, and configuration standards.

By following these practices, you can create a reliable, secure, and scalable Docker golden image management strategy that benefits your development and operations teams.
