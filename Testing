Here’s an example of **acceptance criteria** for a **Container Operations Engineer** in a Jira ticket. This can vary depending on the specific task or project, but here’s a generic template:

---

**Story Title:**  
Deploy a New Kubernetes Cluster on EKS for Development Environment

---

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Cluster Deployment:**  
   - A new EKS cluster is deployed successfully with the following specifications:  
     - Region: `us-east-1`  
     - Node type: `t3.medium`  
     - Minimum nodes: 2  
     - Maximum nodes: 5  
     - Kubernetes version: `1.27`

2. **Networking Configuration:**  
   - The cluster uses a private VPC with properly configured subnets and route tables.  
   - Security groups are configured to allow communication between nodes and load balancers.  
   - Cluster is integrated with existing service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Route 53).

3. **Access Control:**  
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) is configured to restrict cluster admin access to authorized users.  
   - IAM roles are correctly associated with the EKS cluster for node group management.

4. **Observability:**  
   - Cluster monitoring is set up using Prometheus and Grafana.  
   - Logs are shipped to a central logging solution (e.g., CloudWatch).  

5. **Container Workload Deployment:**  
   - A test workload (e.g., Nginx) is deployed and verified to run successfully in the cluster.  
   - The workload is exposed via an Ingress controller with proper annotations for external access.  

6. **Documentation:**  
   - Steps for deploying the cluster are documented in the team's Confluence space.  
   - Any custom configurations or caveats are highlighted.  

7. **Validation:**  
   - All steps pass a peer review process.  
   - Cluster health and performance are verified using standard testing tools.

---

**Definition of Done:**  
- The cluster is operational, meets the acceptance criteria, and is handed over to the application team for further testing.  
- No critical or high-severity issues remain unresolved.
