# Kubernetes Security with Kubesec

## I. Introduction to Kubernetes Security Challenges
- Growing complexity of Kubernetes environments
- Increasing number of security vulnerabilities
- Need for comprehensive security scanning and best practices

## II. What is Kubesec?
### Definition
- Open-source Kubernetes security scanner
- Static analysis tool for Kubernetes resource security
- Identifies potential security risks in Kubernetes manifests

### Key Features
- Scans Kubernetes YAML files
- Provides security ratings and recommendations
- Supports multiple Kubernetes resource types
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines

## III. Core Security Dimensions Kubesec Addresses

### 1. Pod Security
- Container runtime configuration
- Security context analysis
- Privilege escalation prevention
- Root user restriction
- Read-only filesystem checks

### 2. Network Policy Evaluation
- Ingress and egress rule analysis
- Network isolation recommendations
- Identifying overly permissive network configurations

### 3. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Insights
- Service account permissions
- Least privilege principle enforcement
- Identifying excessive cluster-admin rights

## IV. Practical Kubesec Scanning Techniques

### Command-Line Scanning
```bash
# Basic scan of a Kubernetes manifest
kubesec scan pod.yaml

# Scanning multiple files
kubesec scan deployment1.yaml deployment2.yaml

# JSON output for integration
kubesec scan pod.yaml -o json
```

### CI/CD Integration Examples
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Jenkins pipeline integration
- GitLab CI configuration

## V. Best Practices Demonstrated by Kubesec

### Security Recommendations
- Minimizing container capabilities
- Dropping unnecessary Linux capabilities
- Implementing read-only root filesystem
- Non-root container execution
- Resource limit enforcement

### Sample Security Scoring
- Risk scoring mechanism (0-10 scale)
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Actionable remediation suggestions

## VI. Live Demo Scenario
- Scanning a sample vulnerable Kubernetes manifest
- Interpreting Kubesec scan results
- Step-by-step security improvement process

## VII. Advanced Kubesec Features
- Custom rule creation
- Integration with admission controllers
- Webhook support
- Multi-cluster scanning capabilities

## VIII. Complementary Security Tools
- Complementing Kubesec with:
  * Kube-bench
  * Trivy
  * Falco
  * Sysdig Secure

## IX. Conclusion
- Importance of continuous security monitoring
- Kubesec as part of a holistic Kubernetes security strategy
- Evolving landscape of container security
