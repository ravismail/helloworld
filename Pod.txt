## 🧱 **Story 3: Helm Chart Preparation for POC Applications**

**Story Title:**
Develop and validate Helm charts for POC applications

**Description:**
As a DevOps Engineer, I want to create reusable Helm charts to deploy POC applications, so that deployments are standardized, configurable, and easy to manage across environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Common Helm chart templates are created for POC applications.
2. Values files are parameterized for environment-specific configurations.
3. Helm charts validated using `helm lint` and test deployments.
4. Versioning and repository setup completed for chart storage.
5. Documentation for deployment parameters and structure prepared.

## 🚀 **Story 4: Onboard POC Applications to Kubernetes Cluster**

**Story Title:**
Onboard and deploy POC applications to the POC cluster

**Description:**
As a Platform Engineer, I want to onboard and deploy identified POC applications to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts, so that the setup can be validated for deployment automation and functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Identified POC applications deployed using prepared Helm charts.
2. Deployments are successful and applications are reachable.
3. Application logs and metrics are visible through the monitoring stack.
4. Deployment process validated through CI/CD pipeline.
5. Documentation for deployment and troubleshooting is available.
6. Demo conducted to confirm successful onboarding.

Would you like me to also add **story points** and **dependencies** (e.g., Story 2 depends on Story 1, etc.) so you can import directly into Jira?








.Building base images offers several advantages, particularly for teams and organizations that manage complex or large-scale containerized environments. Here are the key benefits:

### 1. **Consistency Across Environments**
   - Provides a uniform foundation for all derived images, ensuring applications run consistently across development, testing, and production.

### 2. **Improved Security**
   - By controlling the contents of the base image, you can minimize vulnerabilities by including only essential packages and regularly applying patches.

### 3. **Faster Build Times**
   - Base images act as reusable layers, reducing the need to rebuild common dependencies for every application, thereby speeding up the CI/CD process.

### 4. **Customization and Control**
   - Allows you to tailor the base image to your organization's needs, including pre-installed tools, configurations, and security policies.

### 5. **Reduced Image Size**
   - By starting with a minimal base image, you can avoid unnecessary bloat, leading to smaller, faster, and more efficient containers.

### 6. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Centralizing updates (e.g., OS patches or dependency upgrades) in the base image simplifies maintenance and reduces the need for repeated updates across multiple images.

### 7. **Versioning and Standardization**
   - Standard base images can be versioned, enabling teams to ensure compatibility and traceability for applications built on top of them.

### 8. **Enhanced Team Collaboration**
   - A shared base image promotes alignment across teams, making it easier to onboard new developers and maintain consistent workflows.

### 9. **Compliance and Auditing**
   - Base images can be built to include necessary compliance tools and configurations, aiding in meeting regulatory requirements and simplifying audits.

### 10. **Scalability**
   - Standardized base images reduce variability, making it easier to scale containerized applications across different clusters or cloud environments.

By building and maintaining robust base images, organizations can streamline development, improve security, and optimize their containerization strategy. Let me know if you'd like tips on implementing these in your workflow!

Building base images involves creating foundational container images that serve as the starting point for other application-specific or environment-specific images. Here's a short guide:

### 1. **Purpose of Base Images**
   - Provide a consistent and minimal environment for applications.
   - Serve as a reusable layer across multiple projects or teams.
   - Reduce duplication and improve build efficiency.

### 2. **Key Steps in Building Base Images**
   1. **Choose a Minimal OS**: Use lightweight operating systems like **Alpine**, **Debian Slim**, or **Ubuntu Minimal** to reduce size and attack surface.
   2. **Install Essential Tools**: Add only the required tools, dependencies, and configurations (e.g., package managers, runtime libraries).
   3. **Keep Security in Mind**: Use updated packages and apply security patches regularly.
   4. **Add Version Control**: Tag your images with meaningful versions (e.g., `v1.0`, `latest`, `stable`).
   5. **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: If required, separate build and runtime stages to keep the image size small.
   6. **Optimize Layers**: Minimize the number of layers in the Dockerfile for faster builds and smaller images.

### 3. **Example Dockerfile for a Base Image**
```dockerfile
# Start with a minimal OS
FROM debian:bullseye-slim

# Set up environment variables
ENV LANG=C.UTF-8 LC_ALL=C.UTF-8

# Install basic tools and update
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    vim \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Add metadata
LABEL maintainer="yourname@example.com"
```

### 4. **Best Practices**
   - Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like **Trivy** or **Snyk**.
   - Document the purpose and included packages in the image.
   - Test your base images thoroughly before deploying them in production.
   - Push to a private registry for internal use (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, or Nexus).

pod.yaml probes section sample

Why they’re crucial:
Without probes, Kubernetes might assume a pod is healthy and route traffic to it even when it’s not ready, leading to downtime or errors.

Pro Tip: Define probes tailored to your application endpoints, and test their configurations in staging before deploying to production.

Affinity
Node and pod affinity control where your pods are scheduled, improving resource utilization and workload performance.


pod.yaml affinity section sample

Hard rules: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution enforces pod placement on specific nodes (e.g., zone=us-west-1a).

Soft preferences: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution prioritizes placement but doesn’t enforce it strictly.

Use it for workloads that benefit from proximity, such as a frontend service colocating with its backend.
