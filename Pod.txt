pod.yaml probes section sample

Why they’re crucial:
Without probes, Kubernetes might assume a pod is healthy and route traffic to it even when it’s not ready, leading to downtime or errors.

Pro Tip: Define probes tailored to your application endpoints, and test their configurations in staging before deploying to production.

Affinity
Node and pod affinity control where your pods are scheduled, improving resource utilization and workload performance.

Hard rules: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution enforces pod placement on specific nodes (e.g., zone=us-west-1a).

Soft preferences: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution prioritizes placement but doesn’t enforce it strictly.

Use it for workloads that benefit from proximity, such as a frontend service colocating with its backend.
